Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage their projects efficiently. It provides powerful features such as branching, merging, and reverting changes, making it easier to work on different parts of a project simultaneously. Git also maintains a complete history of all changes, enabling developers to review and revert to previous versions if needed. Its decentralized nature ensures that every contributor has a full copy of the repository, enhancing collaboration and reducing the risk of data loss.
